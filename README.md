# Modular Programming Assignment 2
A program is required to process information about a worker's weekly earnings.
### Preliminaries:
Create and call a main () function that prints out your name.
Add the following list to main ().
weeks = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
Write each of the following functions and call them from the main () function.
Add print statements as required to verify your code is working.
You may re-use code you have already written by importing the Python file as a module or by copying and pasting the code into your exam's file.
### Q1
Write a function that asks for, reads and returns a worker’s name and their age (ensuring the age is a positive number).
### Q2
Write a function which takes the days of the week list from above as a parameter and returns a list of wages, with one entry for each of the days. The wages for each day should be a positive, floating point number. The day of the week should appear in the prompt.
### Q3
Write a function which accepts the list of wages (produced in q2) and the days of the week as a list, and returns a list of the days on which the wages earned were over € 150.
### Q4
Write a function which accepts the list of wages (produced in q2) and returns the total amount of money required to pay all bonuses if each worker gets a 10% bonus.
### Q5
Write a function which accepts the name, age, days of the week and wages on each day and outputs these details in a neat table. The table should have a # on each line where the wages for that day is greater than € 175.
